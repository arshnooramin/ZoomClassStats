# Zoom Class Meeting Stats
### Description
A simple python script I created for a country wide educational institute as they needed to collect data about all of their meetings and classes. The script generates formatted CSVs of the said data.

## Local Set up
- Clone GitHub repository locally `git clone [repo-link]`
- make sure you have python3 installed
- set up virtual environment
    - `pip install virtualenv`
    - `virtualenv venv`
- to activate environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- install dependancies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- to deactivate: `deactivate`
- create a `.env` file (same directory as `.env.sample`) and add the API key and API secret
- create a `data` directory where the generated reports will be saved
